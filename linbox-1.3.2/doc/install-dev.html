	<p><b><font size=+2>How to install LinBox (for developers using svn)</font></b></center></p>

<p>
When you have retrieved your local svn snapshot, you can configure LinBox with the <b>autogen.sh</b> script.
You can use it exactly the same way <tt>./configure</tt> works (<small>execpt for the --help part... :(</small>) See <a href="install-dist.html">here</a> for additional information on configure script.
</p>
<p>
If you are not sure, run <tt>autogen.sh</tt> with the minimal options so LinBox can be well configured and then you will get more information
with <tt>configure --help</tt>.
</p>
