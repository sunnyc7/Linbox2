/*! \ingroup linbox
 * \defgroup benchmarks Benchmarks
 * @brief This directory is used to perform benchmarks on LinBox.
 * The benchmarks are meant for :
 * - the \e user to guide her through the various choices of
 * algorithms/implementation provided in her particular case.
 * - the \e developper to test her new algorithms against the others or check
 * that the newest shiny subroutine she just wrote didn't deteriorate too much
 * the performance of LinBox :) (regression testing purpose).
 * .
 *
 * Benchmarks can be grouped in :
 * - basic routines (fflas/ffpack, integer operations,...) ;
 * - algorithms ;
 * - solutions.
 * .
 *
 * When another free library (NTL, IML,...) provides a routine that exists in
 * LinBox, we want to be able to compare it to our implementation.
 *
 * Default parameters can be changed on the command-line, just as in \c
 * examples/ and \c tests/.
